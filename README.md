# Sentiment-Analysis-For-Movie
This is the code for How_to_do_Sentiment_Analysis

##Overview

It uses TFLearn to train a Sentiment Analyzer on a set of IMDB Movie ratings. Once trained, given some input text, it will be able to classify it as either positive or negative. The neural network that is built for this is a recurrent network. It uses a technique called LSTM.

##Dependencies

tflearn

Use this guide to install TFLearn. Or just use the Amazon Web Services prebuilt AMI to run this in the cloud

##Usage

Run sentiment analysis.py in terminal and it should start training

##Credits

Credits for this code go to the author of TFLearn. I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
